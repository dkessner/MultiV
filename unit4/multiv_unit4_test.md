__No calculator!  Remember to verify local minima with a 2nd derivative
test where appropriate!  Have fun!__

__1.__  a) Find the points where $f(x,y) = 4x + 3y$ is maximized and minimized
on the unit circle.

\vspace{4in}

b) For each of these points, find the equation of the line tangent to the unit
circle at that point.


\newpage

__2.__  Find the dimensions that maximize the volume of a cylinder
with surface area $600\pi$ (lateral area + top + bottom) in two
different ways: 1) substitution, and 2) Lagrange
multipliers.

\newpage

__3.__  Let $g(x,y) = -x^2 -y^2 -2x -2y -2$.  Find any critical
points and identify as a local min/max or saddle point.  Complete
the square to identify the surface and verify your answer.

\newpage

__4.__  Let $h(x,y) = \sin x \sin y$.

a) Verify that the following are all critical points: $(\pi/2, \pi/2), (\pi/2,
3\pi/2), (\pi, \pi), (3\pi/2, \pi/2), (3\pi/2, 3\pi/2)$

\vspace{2in}

b) Classify each of the critical points using the 2nd derivative test.

\vspace{4in}

__Bonus:__  Characterize the set of _all_ critical points, and specify which
are local minima, local maxima, and saddle points.  Describe the shape of the
graph $z = h(x,y)$.

\newpage

__Bonus:__  Write the 2nd order approximation for a function $f:\mathbb{R}^2
\to \mathbb{R}$.

\vspace{4in}

__Bonus:__  Justify the 2nd derivative test for a function $f:\mathbb{R}^2 \to
\mathbb{R}$.

\newpage

__Bonus:__  Consider the line through $(x_0, y_0)$ that is orthogonal to
$\begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}$.  Show that the point-normal form of the
line is equivalent to the slope-point form of the line.

\vspace{4in}

__Bonus:__  Rotate the multiplication table to show that it is a pringle.  In
other words, rotate the function $m(x,y) = xy$ to remove the $xy$ term and show
that it is actually a hyperbolic paraboloid.
