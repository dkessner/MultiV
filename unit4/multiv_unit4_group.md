__1.__  In $\mathbb{R}^3$, find the distance from the origin to the plane $y + z
= 1$, using 3 different different methods:

a. Use projection (dot product).

b. Minimize the squared distance to the origin $f(x,y,z)=x^2+y^2+z^2$, subject
to the constraint $y + z = 1$.  Solve the constrained optimization problem
using substitution.

c. Solve the constrained optimization problem using Lagrange multipliers.

__2.__  You are designing a cylindrical container to hold a given volume of
liquid (say $1000\pi$ ml).  The container has a circular bottom, but the top is
open.  You want to minimize the amount of material you use for the container
(the surface area).

a. Write the volume $V$ as a function of its radius $r$ and height $h$.  Since
your volume is given and fixed, this gives you a constraint equation.  Write
the surface area $A$ as a function of $r$ and $h$.  This is the function you
want to minimize.

b. Minimize the surface area for the given volume.  Solve the constrained
optimization problem using substitution.

c. Solve the constrained optimization problem using Lagrange multipliers.

__3.__  Maximize the function $f(x,y) = 2x + 3y$ on the unit circle $x^2 + y^2
= 1$ using two different methods:

a. Solve the constrained optimization problem using Lagrange multipliers.

b. Parametrize the circle.
