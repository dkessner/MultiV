__1.__  Consider the function $f(x,y) = 2x^2 -4x +3y^2 +12y +20$.

a. Find the equation of the tangent plane to the surface $z = f(x,y)$ at
$(x,y) = (0,0)$.

b.  A _critical point_ of $f$ is a point $(x,y)$ where both $f_x$ and $f_y$ are
either zero or undefined. Find all critical points of $f$ (there is only one for 
this example).

c. At the critical point, find the linear approximation of $f$.  

d. Let $d^2 \! f$ be the matrix of 2nd partial derivatives: 
$$
d^2 \! f = 
\begin{pmatrix}
    f_{xx} & f_{xy} \\
    f_{yx} & f_{yy} \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$
Find $d^2 \! f$ and $\det d^2 \! f$ (at the critical point).
What does $d^2 f$ tell you about the shape of the surface at the critical
point?

d. Complete the square to write the function in the form $f(x,y) = a(x-h)^2 +
b(y-k)^2 + c$.  What does this tell you about the surface?

__2.__  Do the same calculations for the function $g(x,y) = -4x^2 +16x -5y^2 -11$.


__3.__  Do the same calculations for the function $h(x,y) = x^2 -2x -2y^2 +8y -9$.
