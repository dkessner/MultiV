__Multivariable Calculus (MultiV)__  
__2021-22__   
__Dr. Kessner__  

## Topics

* Unit 1 (3D space & vectors)
* Unit 2 (Vector valued functions)
* Unit 3 (Partial derivatives)
* Unit 4 (Optimization)
* Unit 5 (Multiple integrals)
* Unit 6 (Differential equations)

We will also be using concepts from linear algebra (vectors, matrices, and
more) throughout the course as a tool to understand vector calculus more
deeply.

## Grading

- 50% group work
- 50% individual assessments

## Mathletes

As a MultiV student you will continue to be a mathlete, i.e. 6 CML tests and a
morning AMC test.
