Hello again fellow mathematics enthusiasts!  

I'm very excited to be your teacher for MultiV this year, after having so much
fun in PCHA two years ago!

We will cover the standard topics that you will find in a college-level second
year calculus course.  Basically we'll be taking everything that you've learned
about calculus into higher dimensions.  We will also continue to learn more
linear algebra, which is a very useful tool in mathematics that has
applications in computer graphics, statistics, and machine learning.  We will
also take a first look at differential equations, and in particular how they
can help us understand population growth models related to disease epidemics.

Here's a fun quote from an article "Calculus Is Good for You"
that appeared in _Scientific American_ in 1871 (150 years ago!).

> It is admitted by all metaphysicians and educators that the calculus brings
> into play more faculties of the mind than any other branch of learning.
> Recognizing this fact, professors should consider their institution a mental
> gymnasium, which gives the mind exercise that enables it to perform its highest
> destiny. Herein is the value of solving problems in the calculus, and indeed of
> all other branches of pure mathematicsâ€”that by dealing in abstract ideas, they
> prepare the mind to apply itself vigorously to profound or complicated subjects
> connected with the realities of life."
