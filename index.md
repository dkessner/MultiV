Hello again fellow mathematics enthusiasts!  

I'm very excited to be your teacher for MultiV this year, after having so much
fun in PCHA two years ago!

We will cover the standard topics that you will find in a college-level second
year calculus course.  Basically we'll be taking everything that you've learned
about calculus into higher dimensions.  We will also continue to learn more
linear algebra, which is a very useful tool in mathematics that has
applications in computer graphics, statistics, and machine learning.  We will
also take a first look at differential equations, and in particular how they
can help us understand population growth models related to disease epidemics.
