__1.__  Consider the general helix: 
$$ \vec{r}(t) = \left< a\cos t, a\sin t, bt \right> $$ 

a. Calculate the velocity, speed, and acceleration of this curve.

\vspace{2in}

b. Calculate the tangent $\vec{T}(t)$, normal $\vec{N}(t)$, and binormal
$\vec{B}(t)$ vector functions.

\vspace{2in}

c. Find the equations of the osculating (TN), normal (NB), and rectifying (TB)
planes at $t=0$ and $t=\pi/2$.

\newpage

__2.__  a. Parametrize the general helix as in #1, but this time
oriented along the x-axis. (As in #1, let $a$ be the radius and
$b$ the speed along the axis).

\vspace{2in}

b. Calculate the arc length of the curve as a function of $t$, starting from
$t=0$.

\vspace{2in}

c.  Re-parametrize the curve by arc length.


\newpage

__3.__  Consider the curve given by the spherical equations:
$$\rho = 4$$
$$\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}$$
$$\phi = t$$

a. Parametrize the curve in standard rectangular coordinates
$\vec{r}(t) = \left<x(t), y(t), z(t)\right>$.  What is this curve?

\vspace{4in}

b. Find the arc length of the curve as a function of $t$, and 
re-parametrize by arc length.

\newpage

__4.__ a. Consider the following function defined in polar coordinates:
$$
    r = \frac{12}{2 - \sin\theta}
$$
Sketch the graph of the curve.  Also find the equation of the function in
rectangular coordinates.

\vspace{4in}

b. Consider the following function defined in polar coordinates:
$$
    r = \frac{12}{2 + 2\sin\theta}
$$
Sketch the graph of the curve.  Also find the equation of the function in
rectangular coordinates.
