1.  Let $w = e_1 + e_3$.
    Let $w' = (e_2 e_1)w(e_1 e_2)$

    Show that $w' = -e_1 + e_3$.

    Draw $w$ and $w'$.  Verify that $w'$ is the result of reflecting $w$ in
    $e_1$, and then $e_2$.  Also verify that this equivalent to rotation by
    $\pi$ in the $e_1e_2$ plane.

2.  Let $w = e_1+e_3$.
    Let $u = \frac{w}{\sqrt{2}}$ and $v = e_1$.  Note that $u$ and $v$ are unit
    vectors in the $e_1e_3$ plane, and the angle between the two vectors is
    $\frac{\pi}{4}$.

    Let $w' = (uv)w(uv)$.

    Show that $w' = e_1-e_3$.

    Draw $w$ and $w'$.  Verify that $w'$ is the result of rotating $w$ by
    $\frac{\pi}{2}$ in the $e_1e_3$ plane .

3.  Let $w = e_1 + e_3$.
    Find two vectors $u$ and $v$ to represent rotation by $-\frac{\pi}{4}$ in
    the $e_2e_3$ plane.  (Clockwise $45^{\circ}$ if you're on the positive $e_1$ axis
    looking at the origin).
    Let $w' = (uv)w(uv)$.

    Show that $w' = e_1 + e_2$.
