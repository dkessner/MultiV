__1.__  In $\mathbb{R}^2$, parametrize the quarter circle of
radius 2 from $(2,0)$ to $(0,2)$ (as a curve).  Find the length
and centroid of the curve using integration.  

Now revolve the curve around the y-axis and consider the generated surface (a
hemispherical shell).  Find the lateral surface area of the hemisphere in 4
different ways: 

* use a formula from geometry
* use Pappus' Centroid Theorem 
* compute the surface area of revolution as a single integral
* parametrize the surface and compute a double integral

__2.__  Consider the 2-dimensional region bounded by the quarter
circle above and the axes $x=0$ and $y=0$.  Find the area and
centroid of the region by integration.

Now consider the hemispherical volume generated by revolving the region around
the y-axis.  Find the volume of the hemisphere in 4 different ways: 

* use a formula from geometry
* use Pappus' Centroid Theorem
* compute the volume of revolution as a triple integral in
  cylindrical coordinates in two ways (disks and shells).
