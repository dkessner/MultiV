__1.__  Parametrize the line segment in $\mathbb{R}^2$ from $(0,1)$ to $(4,4)$.
Find the length and centroid of the line segment (using integration).  

Now revolve the segment around the y-axis and consider the generated surface (a
cone).  Find the lateral surface area of the cone in 4 different ways: 

* use a formula
* use Pappus' Centroid Theorem 
* compute the surface area of revolution as a single integral
* parametrize the surface and compute a double integral

__2.__  Consider the triangle bounded by the same line segment and the lines
$x=0$ and $y=4$.  Find the area and centroid of the triangle by integration.

Now consider the solid cone generated by revolving the triangle around the
y-axis.  Find the volume of the cone in 4 different ways: 

* use a formula
* use Pappus' Centroid Theorem
* compute the volume of revolution as a triple integral in
  cylindrical coordinates in two ways (disks and shells).
