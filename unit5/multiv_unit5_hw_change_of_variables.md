__1.__  Find the area of the parallelogram with vertices
$(0,0), (1,2), (2, 1), (3,3)$ in two different ways:

a. Integration (express the area as a sum of 3 double integrals).

b. Change variables using $x = 2u + v$ and $y = u + 2v$, and
integrate over the unit square   
$\{(u,v) \, |  \, 0 \leq u\leq 1, 0 \leq v \leq 1 \}$.

Note that this change-of-variables is a linear transformation, and can be
expressed as a matrix multiplication.  Make sure you understand why you are
integrating over the unit square.

__2.__  Consider the ellipsoid
$$\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} + \frac{z^2}{c^2} = 1$$

a. Express the volume of the ellipsoid as a triple integral, and then look away
in disgust.

b. Apply the change of variables $x=au$, $y=bv$, $z=cw$ to reduce
this problem to computing the volume of the unit sphere.  Then
use spherical coordinates to compute that volume.

__3.__ This exercise is preparation for next class.  Figuring out what calculation
to do is the main part of the exercise.

a. What is the average value of $\sin(x)$ on $[0,\pi]$?  (In other words, what
is the average $y$ value of the points on the curve $y=\sin x$ between $0$ and
$\pi$?)

b. What is the average $y$ value of all the points in the 2-dimensional region
between the $x$-axis and $y=\sin(x)$, for $x \in [0,\pi]$?
