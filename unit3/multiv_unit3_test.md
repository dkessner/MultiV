__1.__ Let $z = f(x,y) = 9-x^2-y^2$.  

a. Draw level sets of $f$ in the $xy$-plane.  What is this surface? 

\vspace{4in}

b. At the following points, find the direction of maximum change $\vec{u}$ and
the directional derivative  in that direction $D_\vec{u}(f)$: $(\pm 3, 0), (0,
\pm 3), (0, 0)$.

\newpage

c.  On the same surface, find the equation of the tangent plane at the the
following points: $(\pm 3, 0), (0, \pm 3), (0, 0)$.

\vspace{4in}

d. Consider the curve $\vec{r}(t) = \left<x(t), y(t)\right> = \left<3+t,
0\right>$, and the composite function $f(t) = f(x(t), y(t))$.  Find $f'(t)$ in
two different ways: 1) standard differentiation, and 2) multivariable chain
rule.

\newpage

e. Consider the curve $\vec{r}(t) = \left<x(t), y(t)\right> = \left<3\cos t,
3\sin t \right>$, and the composite function $f(t) = f(x(t), y(t))$.  Find
$f'(t)$ in two different ways: 1) standard differentiation, and 2)
multivariable chain rule.

\vspace{4in}

f. Consider the curve $\vec{r}(t) = \left<x(t), y(t)\right> = \left<(3+t)\cos t,
(3+t)\sin t \right>$, and the composite function $f(t) = f(x(t), y(t))$.  Find
$f'(t)$ in two different ways: 1) standard differentiation, and 2)
multivariable chain rule.

\newpage

__2.__ Let $F(x,y,z) = \dfrac{x^2}{4} + \dfrac{y^2}{4} + z^2$ and consider the
level surface $F(x,y,z)=1$.  What is this surface?

a. For each of the following points, verify that it is on the
surface, find the direction of maximum change $\vec{u}$, and the
directional derivative in that direction $D_\vec{u}(F)$: $(\pm 2,
0, 0), (0, \pm 2, 0), (0, 0, \pm 1)$.


\vspace{4in}

b. At each of the following points, find the equation of the
tangent plane: 
$(\pm 2, 0, 0), (0, \pm 2, 0), (0, 0,
\pm 1)$.


\newpage

c. Consider the curve 
$\vec{r}(t) = \left<x(t), y(t), z(t)\right> = \left<2\cos t, 2\sin t, 0 \right>$, 
and the composite function 
$F(t) = F(x(t), y(t), z(t))$.  Find $F'(0)$ in two different ways: 1) standard
differentiation, and 2) multivariable chain rule.

\vspace{4in}

d. Consider the curve 
$\vec{r}(t) = \left<x(t), y(t), z(t)\right> = \left<2+t, 0, 0 \right>$, 
and the composite function 
$F(t) = F(x(t), y(t), z(t))$.  Find $F'(0)$ in two different ways: 1) standard
differentiation, and 2) multivariable chain rule.

\newpage

__Bonus__  Suppose you have a surface $z = f(x,y)$.  Show that you can
represent the surface as a level surface of some function $F$ and that the
tangent plane $z = z_0 + f_x \Delta x + f_y \Delta y$ is the same as the plane
given by the point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ and the normal $\nabla F$.

\vspace{4in}

__Bonus__ Derive the double angle formulas for $\sin$ and $\cos$ by rotating
by $\theta$ twice, using the rotation matrix $R_\theta$.

\newpage

__Bonus__ Suppose that $F(x,y,z)=\text{const}$ is a level surface, and
$\vec{r}(t)$ is a curve on the surface.  Show that at any point along the
curve, the tangent vector of the curve is perpendicular to the gradient of the
function.  (Equivalently, the tangent vector of the curve lies in the tangent
plane to the surface.)

\vspace{4in}

__Bonus__ Derive the multivariable chain rule. _Hint: composition of linear transformations_.
$$
    \dfrac{d}{dt} f(x(t), y(t)) = 
        \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x} \dfrac{dx}{dt}  +
        \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial y} \dfrac{dy}{dt}
$$
